Survivable network design is a problem that designing a network that can survive from disconnecting some edges.

Let's assume there is a given undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with costs $c_e \ge 0$ $\forall e \in E$.
Now, let's define connectivity requirments $r_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \cup \\{0\\}$ for all pairs of vertices $i,j \in V$, where $i \neq j$.
Then problem is a find a minimum cost set of edges $F \subset E$ such that $G' = (V,F)$ has $r_{ij}$ edge distinct paths to connecting $i$ and $j$.

Now, we can do a integer programming relaxation over this and it is like follow.
"Minimize $\sum\limits_{e \in E} c_e x_e$ such that $\sum\limits_{e \in \delta(S)} x_e \ge \max\limits_{i \in S, j \not\in S} r_{ij}$ $\forall S \subset V$, $x_e \in \\{0,1\\}$" which $\delta(S)$ denotes the set of edges between $S$ and $V - S$.
Notice that if there is $r_{ij}$ edge distinct paths, we can make flow of value $r_{ij}$ between $i$ and $j$.
Then, there should be a mincut that corresponding to that flow from the network flow theory.
As a result, constraint above should fullfilled.
It's the same in the opposite direction.
If we have a such min-cut then we have such flow either.

Now, we can do a linear programming relaxation like we did in the set cover.
"Minimize $\sum\limits_{e \in E} c_e x_e$ such that $\sum\limits_{e \in \delta(S)} x_e \ge \max\limits_{i \in S, j \not\in S} r_{ij}$ $\forall S \subset V$, $0 \le x_e \le 1$".
We can solve this LP in polynomial time with ellipsoid method.
We can construct seperation orcale like follow.
1. Make a graph that consists of $G = (V,E)$ and set capacity of $E$ as $x_e$.
2. Solve the network flow problem between all pair $i$ and $j$ such that $i \neq j$ and $i,j \in V$.
3. If there is a flow such that the value of flow $f_{ij}$ is less than $r_{ij}$ then it's infeasible solution otherwise it is feasible.

Now, let's define $f(S) = \max\limits_{i \in S, j \not\in S} r_{ij}$.
Then problem will be shifted to "Minimize $\sum\limits_{e \in E} c_e x_e$ such that $\sum\limits_{e \in \delta(S)} x_e f(S)$ $\forall S \subset V$, $0 \le x_e \le 1$".
