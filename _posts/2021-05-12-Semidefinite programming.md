To show what is semidefinite programming, we need to know what is semidefinite matrix.

1. $S_n$ is the set of $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix.
2. We call symmetric matrix $X$ $\in$ $S_n$ is positive semidefinite if for all $x \in \mathcal{R}^{n}$, $x^TXx \ge 0$.
3. For $A,B$ $\in$ $S_n$, inner product of $A,B$ is defined as $\\<A,B\\> = tr(A^T B)$
